# ClickyKitties
Cat clicker exercise.

Practicing the concept of an MV* framework by creating a cat clicker. Click the name of a cat on the list, and that cat will display in the UI along with their unique click counter. Only one cat is displayed at any given time.

Cat names are based on nicknames for my own cat, Pepsi.
